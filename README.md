## Part 1 Corrections  
I wanted to confirm that I've submitted my proposal with the Git link. Although Mr.j. jessel sookha  recently updated us with the submission instructions, I received them but are a bite confusing,
I wasn't entirely sure about the submission.

I completed second propsal with  sufficient content and added it to my ReadMe file. I made the content more comprehensive and better organised.  
The folder structure was updated to give a logical and user-friendly navigation pattern.  
Added inline comments throughout the code to improve readability and understanding.  

### Fixes from Part 1  
- Corrected navigation bar placement (made it consistent across all pages).  
- Fixed image folder naming (renamed to `images/` lowercase).  
- Improved semantic HTML (alt tags, proper headings).
- improved comments on all code in the HTML by fully explaing evry code 

---

## Part 2 Updates  

### File & Folder Restructure  
- All `.html` files moved to the project root for easier access.  
- `styles.css` moved into a new `css/` folder and renamed `style.css`.  
- `images/` folder cleaned up and renamed to lowercase for consistency.  

### New Features / Work Done in Part 2  
- Redesigned most pages for better aesthetics.  
- Added responsive navigation and footer across all pages.  
- Styled **Essentials page table** with a mobile-friendly stacked card layout.  
- Added animations for images and hover effects for CTA buttons.  
- Redesigned **Contact page** into a two-column layout (form + details sidebar).  
- Embedded **maps** for Johannesburg and Cape Town to show drop-off locations.

My project proposal presents the Bora Foundation, which supports orphaned children. The website will feature donation pages, essentials needed, and impact stories showcasing the difference every donation makes, whether in goods or finance.
