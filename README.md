## Part 1 Corrections  
I wanted to confirm that I've submitted my proposal with the Git link. Although Mr.j. jessel sookha  recently updated us with the submission instructions, I received them but are a bite confusing,
I wasn't entirely sure about the submission.

I completed second propsal with  sufficient content and added it to my ReadMe file. I made the content more comprehensive and better organised.  
The folder structure was updated to give a logical and user-friendly navigation pattern.  
Added inline comments throughout the code to improve readability and understanding.  

### Fixes from Part 1  
- Corrected navigation bar placement (made it consistent across all pages).  
- Fixed image folder naming (renamed to `images/` lowercase).  
- Improved semantic HTML (alt tags, proper headings).
- improved comments on all code in the HTML by fully explaing evry code 

---

## Part 2 Updates  

### File & Folder Restructure  
- All `.html` files moved to the project root for easier access.  
- `styles.css` moved into a new `css/` folder and renamed `style.css`.  
- `images/` folder cleaned up and renamed to lowercase for consistency.  

### New Features / Work Done in Part 2  
- Redesigned most pages for better aesthetics.  
- Added responsive navigation and footer across all pages.  
- Styled **Essentials page table** with a mobile-friendly stacked card layout.

## Part 2 Fixes  

I fixed my referencing, provided a **detailed changelog**, and ensured that my website is **fully responsive and visually consistent** across all pages.  
I also organised my GitHub commits clearly, showing step-by-step progress during development.  

Additional updates included:
- Improved **Harvard referencing** for full consistency and correct citation format.  
- Created a **comprehensive changelog section** to record all development milestones.  

---

## **Part 3 Overview**  

Part 3 builds upon Part 1 and 2 by adding **functionality, JavaScript enhancements, SEO improvements, and validation**.  
The Bora Foundation website now includes interactive and accessible features designed to enhance user experience and demonstrate dynamic web skills.

---


###  SEO & Performance Optimisation  
- Added **robots.txt** and **sitemap.xml** for search engine indexing.  
- Integrated **Open Graph** and **Twitter Card** tags for social media sharing.  
- Included **canonical links, favicon, and theme colour** for all pages.  
- Improved HTML structure, accessibility, and keyword consistency.  

---

### CSS Update: From `styles.css` to `site.css`  
The global stylesheet was renamed from **`styles.css`** to **`site.css`** for better clarity and alignment with web development naming conventions.  
This change ensures that:  
- The file name matches the project’s structure (used consistently in all HTML files).  
- Future updates and maintenance are simplified.  
- It avoids confusion with previous versions or temporary backup style sheets used during Part 2.  

The **`site.css`** file now holds all consolidated and optimised design rules, including:  
- Responsive layout fixes.  
- Consistent colour tokens and typography.  
- New animations and section transitions used in Part 3 features.  

---

### JavaScript Organisation: `main.js`  
All dynamic behaviour and DOM interactions were grouped into a single script file called **`main.js`** located in the `js/` directory.  
This structure was created to:  
- Keep the HTML clean and lightweight.  
- Reuse scripts like search functionality, accordion toggles, and form validation across multiple pages.  
- Display toast notifications and confirmation messages.  
- Animate elements during scrolling for smoother UX.  
- Support maintainability by having one central file for all interactive features introduced in Part 3.  

These updates improved the website’s **readability, reusability, and professional file organisation**, which are key outcomes of the Part 3 requirements.

##  Conclusion  

The Bora Foundation project demonstrates my full web development process — from planning and structuring pages to implementing responsive design, functionality, and SEO optimisation.  

Through each part of the POE, I was able to strengthen my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while learning how to create a website that is both visually appealing and user-friendly. The website now provides donors and visitors with a clear understanding of the foundation’s goals, as well as easy ways to contribute and get involved.  

This project also helped me gain valuable experience in version control using GitHub, ensuring proper documentation, commit tracking, and professional presentation of my work.  

Overall, completing this website was an important milestone in my learning journey, allowing me to apply both technical and design principles to create a meaningful and functional online platform for a real-world cause.
